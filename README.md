Hi,
you can follow my work with flask.

If you'd like to start playing with this app, build it. Firstly fill your .env based on sample_.env.
<ul>Then you can run:
<li>docker compose up --build</li>
<li>docker exec -it flask_app /bin/bash</li>
<li>flask db init </li>
<li>flask db migrate -m "first docker update" </li>
<li>flask db upgrade</li>
</ul>

It's for now   :)

Your app is on localhost:5000
Your pgadmin localhost:5050

Have a good day! </br>
